The March for Science
Real issue: America’s war with facts and science
As Christians we can often be taught to treat science with distrust. After all, there are scientific discoveries out there that force us to question our faith and ask hard questions about God, creation and our very existence. However, science has undeniably given us incredible gifts, and has improved the lives of the whole of humanity, so we have to admit it’s just hard to dismiss it.
Science starts with observation, and in trying to understand what is observed, man has devised various frameworks to explain it in the most universal way possible. This is called the scientific method, and it works!
When I first heard about the March for Science I was dumbfounded. Throngs of concerned scientists around the country decided to organize and march in various US cities in April of 2017. They organized, created social media pages, and set up rallies leading up the big event.
Why was I dumbfounded, you ask? Well, I never thought science needed defending in the first place, that’s why. 
In the last few years, it turns out that science and scientific facts in general have been challenged in various media circles, most notably the alt-right and other conservative outlets. We are suddenly second-guessing the work science is producing.
How can we be declaring war on science? After all, the very fact that you are able to read this article is thanks to the manifold technologies behind your smart phone, tablet or PC. Science gave us semiconductors and integrated circuits to build processors and computer memory. Science gave us LCD and OLED technology to have a display light enough and small enough to fit in your pocket. Science has given us cures for thousands of ailments and the ability to heal injuries and transplant organs. Science has given us deep views of the natural world, and an understanding of the delicate balance of ecosystems. Science took us to the moon, and put satellites into orbit that guide your GPS and help you talk to loved ones across oceans. I could go on.
So how then, does science need defending? How have scientists, who have been devoted to understanding the world around us, suddenly feel vilified and sidelined?
Here is one theory. Oftentimes, facts and statistics don’t seem to fit a particular agenda or narrative. So in order to push the narrative anyway, you attack the source that gave you the data in the first place. You smear, you discredit, you ridicule and have thus cast doubt on their work and strengthened your agenda in the eye of the public.
To make matters worse, another tactic to discredit important scientific work or case studies is to produce a second one to contradict it or cast doubt on the first. A classic example is the tobacco industry. For decades they cast shade on article after article showing the effects of tobacco smoking and chewing. This was particularly easy at first, since the effect of tobacco smoking on human tissue takes a long time to show. Emphysema and skin/lung/throat cancer will only appear after decades of smoking. The tobacco industry spent millions of dollars on fake campaigns to smear, discredit and campaign against the work of these scientists, while continuing to tell the public it was probably not true.
Today we are seeing the same issue with climate change. Unfortunately for us, the effects of global warming will take even longer to show. Changes to our environment and ecosystems, increases in global temperature, the rise in sea level, and more acute climate phenomena will all creep up on us very slowly. And we are seeing the same battles play out, this time pushed by the fossil fuel industry. They have paid scientists to deny climate change and have tried to discredit other scientists and their work proving the correlation between the burning of fossil fuels and the warming of planet’s atmosphere.  
So where do we go from here? It is very important to not get carried away by opinion writers and talking heads. Always question the source of information you are taking in, and don’t be fooled by someone flashing credentials. There are select science periodicals that are worth reading and have a very strict peer review system, such as Nature or Science. Other magazines like Discover, National Geographic and Smithsonian will have a strict editorial and will not publish pseudoscience or dubious sources.
It’s also easy to discern if something is bogus if you just Google it. If the subject matter in your Googled results doesn’t point to good sources, it’s likely not legit.
